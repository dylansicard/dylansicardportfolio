### Description

This project utilizes **DOM manipulation** with a little CSS to create a set of eyes that follow your cursor around the page.
<br>

### How to run:

To run this project, simply head go to [This Page](https://dylansicard.github.io/dylansicardportfolio/projects/eye-exercise/index.html) and watch as the eyes follow your cursor around.

### Future Improvements

I would like to add the navbar in the future, to keep this within the navigation of my portfolio
