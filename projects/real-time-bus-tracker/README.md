<br>

### Description

This project utilizes **recursion**, along with the map api **Mapbox**. The project moves the marker through a bus route, stopping at each stop of the route and moving the marker there.
<br>

### How to run:

To run this project, simply head go to [This Page](https://dylansicard.github.io/dylansicardportfolio/projects/real-time-bus-tracker/index.html) and click "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard".

### Future Improvements

I would like to work more with Mapbox in the future; I'd like to do some heatmaps showing various statistics. Also, I tried to implement my navbar on this page but ran into some bugs -- I'd like to come back to get the navbar implemented, to keep this within my portfolio.
